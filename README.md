# 📦 PlayerTools
A lightweight Turtle WoW addon that adds useful right‑click menu tools for players, guild leaders, and community organizers.

PlayerTools extends the default UnitPopup (right‑click) menus with three practical options:

### 🔸 Guild Invite (conditional)
Displayed only if your guild rank has the *Invite Member* permission.  

### 🔸 Armory Link
Opens a popup with a direct link to:
```
https://turtlecraft.gg/armory/<realm>/<player>
```

### 🔸 Log Link
Opens a popup with a direct link to:
```
https://turtlogs.com/armory/character/Turtle WoW <realm>/<player>
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Slow loading on login
In some cases the addon may take a while (10–300 seconds) to initialize after logging in.  
This happens because PlayerTools must wait for `GuildControlGetRankFlags()` to return valid guild‑permission data before the right‑click menu entries can be safely added.  
The delay depends entirely on how quickly the server provides this information, and the timing can vary from login to login.  
There is currently no reliable way to speed this up without risking incorrect or missing menu entries.
